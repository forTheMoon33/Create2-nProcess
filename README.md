# Create2-nProcess

The goal is to create 2^n process with each printing a message: I am process #x.

n is pass from command line.

In the document I used two methods, one is to simply loop for 2^n times, and another is by using a n times loop, doubling the amount of process with fork()'s duplication charactor.
