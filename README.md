# Create2-nProcess

This is a project homework from Operating System course. However the second method wasn't suitable for the requst of the assignment, so I uploaded it here.

The goal is to create 2^n process with each printing a message: I am process #x, where n is pass from command line.

In the document I introduced two methods, one is to simply loop for 2^n times, and another is by using a n times loop, doubling the amount of process with fork()'s duplication charactor.
